1. What does higher redshift physically mean?

High redshift galaxies are extremely distant, ancient galaxies whose light has been stretched to longer (redder) wavelengths by the expansion of the universe, meaning we see them as they were billions of years ago, offering crucial insights into the early universe's formation and evolution. Physically, a high redshift (z > 2) indicates these galaxies are very far away, moving away from us rapidly due to space itself expanding, and are observed as they existed shortly after the Big Bang.
- Cosmological Distance: The light has traveled vast distances through expanding space, stretching its wavelength.
- Time Travel: Observing high-redshift galaxies is like looking back in time, revealing galaxies in their infancy, a few billion years after the universe began.
- Expansion of the Universe: Their extreme redshift is key evidence for the ongoing expansion of the universe, a cornerstone of the Big Bang theory.
- Early Universe Galaxies: These galaxies were forming stars at high rates, often smaller and more chaotic than modern galaxies.
- Galaxy Evolution: Studying them helps scientists understand how galaxies grew, merged, and developed their structures and gas content in the early cosmos.
- Probes of Dark Energy: Their distances and recession speeds help constrain models of dark energy, the mysterious force accelerating the universe's expansion.


2. Why do we start simulations at very high z?

By starting at the beginning (high redshift), we ensure that the "physics" of the digital universe evolves naturally rather than being forced by the programmer.

3. What happens if grid resolution is too low?

In cosmological simulations, the grid resolution (or particle mass in particle-based codes) determines the smallest physical scale the simulation can "see." If this resolution is too low, the simulation fails to capture the critical non-linear physics that transforms smooth early-universe gas into structured galaxies.
