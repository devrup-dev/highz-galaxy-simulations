# High-Redshift Galaxy Simulations (z > 8.5)

This repository documents my self-learning journey into
cosmological galaxy simulations using **Enzo** and **Gadget-4**.

## Goals
- Understand the physics of early galaxy formation
- Learn how cosmological simulation codes are structured
- Connect simulations with observations (JWST-era)

## Codes of Interest
- Enzo (AMR, grid-based)
- Gadget-4 (SPH / moving mesh)

## Status
🚧 Learning in progress
